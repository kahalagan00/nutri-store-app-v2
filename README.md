## Project Overview

Jhuv Nutrition is a full-stack e-commerce application built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API to manage product data, user authentication, and orders. MongoDB serves as the database, storing product information, user profiles, and transaction history. On the frontend, React handles the user interface, enabling dynamic product browsing, secure login, and a smooth checkout process, while React Router ensures seamless navigation throughout the site.

Key features of the application include user authentication with JWT tokens, the ability to add products to a shopping cart, and an integrated payment system. Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, ensuring the app is both visually appealing and responsive across devices. This project demonstrates the full scope of MERN stack development, from API integration to frontend design, providing a solid foundation for a modern, scalable e-commerce platform.
