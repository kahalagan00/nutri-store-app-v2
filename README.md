# Nutri Store App V2

Welcome to Jhuv Nutrition, a full-stack e-commerce platform built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and powered entirely by TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience. The backend, developed with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, handles product data, user authentication, and order management, while MongoDB stores critical application data. On the frontend, React and TypeScript work together to create a dynamic and reliable user interface, offering a seamless and interactive shopping experience. For fast and efficient development, the project uses Vite as the build tool, ensuring quick bundling and hot module replacement. Styled with Tailwind CSS, the application is responsive, modern, and user-friendly across all devices. This project demonstrates the power of TypeScript throughout the entire stack, delivering a high-performance, scalable e-commerce platform.

## Project Overview

Jhuv Nutrition is a full-stack e-commerce application built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, providing a RESTful API to manage product data, user authentication, and orders. MongoDB serves as the database, storing product information, user profiles, and transaction history. On the frontend, React handles the user interface, enabling dynamic product browsing, secure login, and a smooth checkout process, while React Router ensures seamless navigation throughout the site.

Key features of the application include user authentication with JWT tokens, the ability to add products to a shopping cart, and an integrated payment system (with future enhancements in development). Tailwind CSS is used for utility-first styling, ensuring the app is both visually appealing and responsive across devices. This project demonstrates the full scope of MERN stack development, from API integration to frontend design, providing a solid foundation for a modern, scalable e-commerce platform.
